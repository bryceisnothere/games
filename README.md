welcome to bryce's games, a lightweight, fast, clean game site. (allegedly)

## Features
- fast
- clean
- many games
- sys admin approves 👍

## Copy this site for yourself

this site was made to be a quick game website that would easily load on most low-end devices. if you decide to clone this repo, please credit comehow. here's how:
1. fork (or clone) this repo (pls star the original repo)
2. edit the files (mainly the files in the `config` folder)
3. optionally, add more games ([Get some here](https://gitlab.com/3kh0/3kh0-assets))
4. host it on your server or any static web host.
5. enjoy!

> a known issue is game files; because some games are massive, they will fail on many services. There is no straightforward fix, but you can try to host the files on your server.

## Configuration

All the configuration is done in the `config` folder.
- `games.json`: It contains the games' names, icons, and link.

## To-Do
- add more games
- make a better ux/ui

## Credit
